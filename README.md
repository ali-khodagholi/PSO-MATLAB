# PSO-MATLAB
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) within MATLAB Language Programming

This is a metaheuristic algorithm for optimizing single objective problems.

## How to Run
1. Change `cost_function.m` file according your objective function
2. Change pso parameter in `main.m` file
3. Modify results section in `main.m` file for generating results graph
4. Run `main.m`
